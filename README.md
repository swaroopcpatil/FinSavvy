# Project Name
This project is AI financial Advisor. 

## Description
FinSavvy is a project focused on creating an AI-powered financial advisor application. This application leverages advanced machine learning models to analyze financial data and provide users with personalized financial advice and insights. The project involves several components, including code, data, models, and various setup scripts and configurations to ensure a smooth development and deployment process.

## Getting Started
Getting Started with FinSavvy
Welcome to FinSavvy! This guide will help you get started with setting up and running the AI-powered financial advisor application.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

NVIDIA AI Workbench: To manage your project environment and build processes.
Docker: To containerize your application.
Python 3.8+: The programming language used for this project.
Git: Version control system to manage your project files.
Step-by-Step Setup
Clone the Repository:

Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine.
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/finsavvy.git
cd finsavvy
Choose and Set Up the Environment:

Open NVIDIA AI Workbench.
Select the "PyTorch 2.1 Base with CUDA 12.2" environment. This environment includes Python, JupyterLab, and CUDA for GPU acceleration.
Install System Dependencies:

Ensure your system packages are up to date:
sh
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
Install the required system packages listed in apt.txt:
sh
Copy code
sudo apt-get install -y $(cat apt.txt)
Install Python Dependencies:

Install the necessary Python packages from requirements.txt:
sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Environment Variables:

Set up environment variables by sourcing the variables.env file:
sh
Copy code
source variables.env
Run Setup Scripts:

Execute the pre-build script (if provided) to prepare the environment:
sh
Copy code
./preBuild.bash
After the build process, run the post-build script to finalize the setup:
sh
Copy code
./postBuild.bash
Launch JupyterLab:

Open JupyterLab to start developing and testing your application:
sh
Copy code
jupyter lab
Explore and Develop:

Navigate to the provided Jupyter Notebooks (e.g., Untitled.ipynb) in the JupyterLab interface.
Use these notebooks for exploratory data analysis, model development, and experimentation.
Directory Structure
code/: Contains the main application logic and scripts.
data/: Holds the financial datasets for training and testing.
models/: Stores the trained machine learning models.
.gitattributes: Configurations for Git.
.gitignore: Specifies files to ignore in Git.
README.md: Project documentation.
apt.txt: List of system packages to be installed.
postBuild.bash: Script to run after the build process.
preBuild.bash: Script to run before the build process.
requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies.
variables.env: Environment variables for configuration.
Using OpenAI API
To integrate the OpenAI API into your project:

Install OpenAI Python Package:

sh
Copy code
pip install openai
Set Up API Key:

Add your OpenAI API key to the variables.env file:
env
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
Use OpenAI API in Your Code:

Example usage in your Python scripts:
python
Copy code
import os
import openai

openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

response = openai.Completion.create(
    engine="davinci",
    prompt="What are the latest trends in financial markets?",
    max_tokens=100
)

print(response.choices[0].text)
By following these steps, you should be able to set up and start using FinSavvy effectively. Explore the notebooks, build your models, and enhance the application as needed.
